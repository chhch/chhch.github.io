Drafts are posts without a date. They’re posts you’re still working on and don’t want to publish yet.

To preview your site with drafts, simply run jekyll serve or jekyll build with the --drafts switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.
